# Barbershop
This is a **Telegram bot** I made to one of the barbers in my local town. 

He asked to make a Telegram bot in which he could show what time slots are available without having to ask him. 

In order to store and get the information about free time slots **Google Spreadsheet** was used. 

Every time user interacts with the bot the information is updated by calling **Google Spreadsheet API**.

Now, the bot is being used by **60** clients of the barber monthly.
